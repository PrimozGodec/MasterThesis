Since the color photography came in everyday use in last fifty years our grandparents are still owning many black and white photographs which they like to look at to remember the old times. We would like to colorize them automatically. It encourages researchers to develop approaches for black and white photographs and video colorization.

In this thesis we present new approaches for automatic black and white photo colorization based on convolutional neural networks which are working on parts of images instead of taking into account full image. That approaches allows us to color images of different size to those used for training with almost equal accuracy. We also present comparison between our own approaches and those presented in related works.
