Since the color photography came into everyday use in the last fifty years our grandparents are still owning many black and white photographs which we would like to colorize. Researchers are therefore encouraged to develop algorithmic approaches for black and white photographs and video colorization.  
We have developed a set of automatic approaches based on the machine learning and neural networks, which are using regression and classification. We compared them with approaches from related work.  
Our approaches reach the quality of colorization comparable to those from related works. Our new approach on image parts improves colorization of images which size is different from those from the training set. This approach is also faster in training than existing approaches that uses full images for learing.
