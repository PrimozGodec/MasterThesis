Since the color photography came in everyday use in last fifty years our grandparents are still owning many black and white photographs. We would like to colorize them automatically. It encourages researchers to develop approaches for black and white photographs and video colorization.

In this thesis we developed more different automatic approaches based on neural networks which are based on regressiona and classification. We compared that approaches with aproaches from related works. We tested approaches on several old pictures.

Our approaches reach the quality of colorization of approaches from related works. Our new approach on image parts improve colorization of different size than images on which neural network was trained compared to related work also training of approaches on image parts is fater than approach on full images.
