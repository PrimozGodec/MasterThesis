abstract = {Image steganalysis is to discriminate innocent images and those suspected images with hidden messages. This task is very challenging for modern adaptive steganography, since modifications due to message hiding are extremely small. Recent studies show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated superior performances than traditional steganalytic methods. Following this idea, we propose a novel CNN model for image steganalysis based on residual learning. The proposed Deep Residual learning based Network (DRN) shows two attractive properties than existing CNN based methods. First, the model usually contains a large number of network layers, which proves to be effective to capture the complex statistics of digital images. Second, the residual learning in DRN preserves the stego signal coming from secret messages, which is extremely beneficial for the discrimination of cover images and stego images. Comprehensive experiments on standard dataset show that the DRN model can detect the state of arts steganographic algorithms at a high accuracy. It also outperforms the classical rich model method and several recently proposed CNN based methods.},

abstract = {Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a ``colorization Turing test,'' asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32Â {\{}{\%}{\}} of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

abstract = {Abstract. In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Ro- bust Features). It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURF's strong performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for distance-based outliers that is based on the distance of a point from its kth nearest neighbor. We rank each point on the basis of its distance to its kth nearest neighbor and declare the top n points in this ranking to be outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to finding such outliers based on the classical nested-loop join and index join algorithms, we develop a highly efficient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm first partitions the input data set into disjoint subsets, and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it is determined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings in computation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life and synthetic data sets. The results from a real-life NBA database highlight and reveal several expected and unexpected aspects of the database. The results from a study on synthetic data sets demonstrate that the partition-based algorithm scales well with respect to both data set size and data set dimensionality.},

abstract = {â This paper proposes an approach for the segmentation of color images using CIELab color space and Ant based clustering. Image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics. The objective of segmentation is to change the image into meaningful form that is easier to analyze. This paper elaborates the ant based clustering for image segmentation. CMC distance is used to calculate the distance between pixels as this color metric gives good results with CIELab color space. Results show the segmentation using ant based clustering and also verifies that number of clusters for the image with the CMC distance also varies. Clustering quality is evaluated using MSE measure.},

@article{Hinton2015,
abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7{\%} mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.},

@article{Donahue2016,
abstract = {The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing that the latent space of such generators captures semantic variation in the data distribution. Intuitively, models trained to predict these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

@article{Lotter2016,
abstract = {While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network ("PredNet") architecture that is inspired by the concept of "predictive coding" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. Altogether, these results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.},

@article{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Our method ex-ploits a LEARCH framework to train a quadratic objective function in the chromaticity maps, comparable to a Gaus-sian random field. The coefficients of the objective function are conditioned on image features, using a random forest. The objective function admits correlations on long spatial scales, and can control spatial error in the colorization of the image. Images are then colorized by minimizing this objective function. We demonstrate that our method strongly outperforms a natural baseline on large-scale experiments with images of real scenes using a demanding loss function. We demon-strate that learning a model that is conditioned on scene produces improved results. We show how to incorporate a desired color histogram into the objective function, and that doing so can lead to further improvements in results.},

@article{Koleini2010,
abstract = {This study represents an innovative automatic method for black and white films colorization using texture features and a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. In the proposed method, efforts are made to remove human interference in the process of colorization and replace it with an artificial neural network (ANN) which is trained using the features of the reference frame. Later, this network is employed for automatic colorization of the remained black and white frames. The reference frames of the black and white film are manually colored. Using a Gabor filter bank, texture features of all the pixels of the reference frame are extracted and used as the input feature vector of the ANN, while the output will be the color vector of the corresponding pixel. Finally, the next frames' feature vectors are fed respectively to the trained neural network, and color vectors of those frames are the output. Applying AVI videos and using various color spaces, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed colorization process. This method needs considerable time to provide a reasonable output, given rapidly changing scenes. Fortunately however, due to the high correlation between consecutive frames in typical video footage, the overall performance is promising regarding both visual appearance and the calculated MSE error. Apart from the application, we also aim to show the importance of the low level features in a mainly high level process, and the mapping ability of a neural network.},

Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification data-base to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements.
